# Gun-Library
This is a gun library for gorilla tag cheating. This is an easy way to create a gun by just calling this function and putting in an action and if you want it to lock on or not.


## How to use?
You call the gun so GunHandler.Gun(delegate{
// Your function inside of this.
}, false); // change false to true if you want it to lock on to the players.
